#### TransactionKit is a collection of headless React Components that take the pain out of Web3 development. Here are just some of the features of TransactionKit:

#### ðŸ‘‰ Supports 13 chains and their testnets
You read that right. TransactionKit is built on top of Etherspot and helps make your app truly multichain. TransactionKit supports Etheruem, Polygon, Gnosis, Binance, Fantom, Aurora, Avalanhe, Optimism, Arbitrum, Moonbean, Celo, Fuse and Arbitrum Nova.

#### ðŸ‘‰ Transaction Batching out the box
Organise your transactions into batches to have them execute together. Each batch can be performed on a different blockchain.

#### ðŸ‘‰ Zero configuration
You bring the code and we'll handle the infrastructure. Built with your productivity and speed in mind. No need to configure infrastructure providers, no signups needed. Just install the code and start sending transactions.

#### ðŸ‘‰ Total design freedom
TransactionKit is a headless collection of React Components and does not impose any existing user interfaces on you. You design and build how you envision your app, and we'll handle all the technical complexity.

## Sounds good? I thought so. Lets install
```
npm i @etherspot/transaction-kit
```
